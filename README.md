# Features:

A JSON file is used as a flat data file to store data about created projects.

Pug is utilised to build templates that access the JSON data to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

Node.js and Express is used to:

Import the required dependencies
Link the JSON with the Pug templates
Set up routes to handle requests
Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
Handle errors
Set up a server to serve the project

This project demonstrates my comfortable working knowledge of Node.js, Express and Pug, setting up a server, handling requests, working with server-side JavaScript, and building a powerful and modern back end project. 


 ```npm start``` will run the app.

**Exceeds**
